# ER Modeling Assignment

## Grading
The single most important part of a database design is documentation of the ten required model components. This includes the following.
* A description of your miniworld
* A detailed description of each entity type, including justification of keys, and sufficiency of attributes
* A detailed description of each relationship type, including a justification of participation and cardinality constraints
* A detailed description of how you modeled each of the individual components

## Database Modeling

The assignment is to build an Entity-Relationship model within the area of medical care, it could be a hospital, or medical clinic, or surgeon, etc. The area is incompletely specified, the group is to choose a direction, research the area, and supply the necessary details. You may extend the description to incorporate "reasonable" components that satisfy the various required deliverables, which are listed below. For instance, you will need a many-one relationship type with total participation on the one side and so will have to include that in your model.
 

The ER model that the group develops must have five or more entity types, and generally it should not have more than twenty. Make suitable assumptions where necessary and add suitable attributes wherever appropriate.

## DEliverables and Submission Instructions
* create directory called model
    * turn in a .doc, .pdf, or .ps
* ER Diagram - Cut and paste the ER or UML diagram from whatever tool that you decide to use.
* Overview - An overview of the entire model (from one to four paragraphs) presenting the model, design decisions, and general assumptions. This is a joint contribution.
* Detailed description of one entity type - Discuss in detail one entity type, including its attributes.
* Detailed description of one relationship type - Discuss in detail one entity type.
* List of model requirements (see below for structure, each deliverable should be addressed). List and discuss how each deliverable is modeled.
* Physical Schema - The physical schema that results from mapping the ER diagram to relations, including any assumptions in the mapping. The Schema can be a list of create table statements. You may include a screen dump of your physical schema if your tool supports it.

To get a screen dump, e.g., of an ER diagram in Windows, use ALT-PRINT SCREEN which copies the screen to your clipboard (it can then be pasted in, for example, Microsoft Word). Alternatively some of the tools can produce a "report" of the diagram in one or more formats that can be included in a design document.
 

Turnin the files individually or zip or tar and gzip the directory to create the file model.zip or model.tar.gz to turnin. Turnin in the assignment using canvas. You may turnin your assignment as many times as you like.

## Model Requirements

Your model must contain each of the following. In the documentation show the part of the ER diagram that you used for modeling, for instance, cut and past the ternary relationship type into an image and include that in your model.
* A many-one relationship type with total participation on the one side
* A many-many relationship type
* A ternary relationship type
* A disjoint inheritance hierarchy
An overlapping inheritance hierarchy
* A composite attribute
* A multivalued attribute
* A one-one relationship type with total participation on at least one side
* A one-many relationship type with partial participation on both sides
* A relationship with an attribute(s)
* A weak-entity type
* A reflexive relationship type
